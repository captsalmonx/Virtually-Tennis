# Virtually-Tennis
3D physics based tennis game built using OpenGL.

Built for an OpenGL assignment, this project uses example code as provided by https://github.com/capnramses/opengl_test_drive_clone.
This is created as an example of advanced collision detection using fully realised 3D physics, within the OpenGL framework with shaders and rendering.
